# Integrative Transcriptomic and Proteomic Approaches for the development of neoantigen based cancer Vaccine in Middle Eastern Patients
# Abstract
Neoantigens, which result from tumor-specific mutations, are promising targets for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Identifying and validating these neoantigens is essential but challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and immune evasion. We aim to develop an integrated approach that combines transcriptomics and proteomics for the comprehensive discovery and validation of neoantigens to create effective cancer vaccines among most common cancers. By leveraging RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we aim to identify, validate, and functionally characterize neoantigens across various cancer types. This approach will advance the development of personalized neoantigen-based cancer vaccines and improve therapeutic outcomes.
