# Integrative Transcriptomic and Proteomic Approaches for the Development of Neoantigen based cancer Vaccine in Middle Eastern Patients
# Lay Abstract
Cancer affects individuals differently due to their genetic makeup and environmental factors. Middle Eastern cancer patients have unique genetic profiles that can impact their susceptibility to cancer and their response to treatments. Unfortunately, there has been limited research on developing personalized cancer treatments for this population.

Our project aims to address this gap by creating personalized cancer vaccines specifically designed for Middle Eastern cancer patients. These vaccines will target neoantigens, which are unique markers found on tumor cells that can activate the body's immune system to combat cancer. By utilizing advanced techniques to analyze the genetic and protein profiles of tumor samples from Middle Eastern patients, we will identify these unique neoantigens and develop vaccines customized to target them.

Our methodology involves collecting tumor samples from Middle Eastern cancer patients while adhering to ethical guidelines and obtaining informed consent. We will conduct high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry to gather comprehensive genetic and protein data from the tumor samples. Using advanced bioinformatics tools, we will identify potential neoantigens and assess their immunogenic potential. The identified neoantigens will be synthesized into peptide-based vaccines and tested in vitro to measure their ability to elicit immune responses. The most promising vaccine candidates will undergo testing in animal models to evaluate their efficacy and safety.

In conclusion, our project aims to develop effective, personalized cancer treatments to enhance the prognosis and outcomes for Middle Eastern patients with breast and lung cancer. By focusing on this underserved demographic, we seek to promote more equitable healthcare advancements and contribute to the global movement towards personalized medicine. This innovative approach has the potential to significantly improve cancer treatment and provide new hope for patients in the Middle East.

# Scientific Abstract
Our proposal aims to identify and develop neoantigen-based vaccines specifically tailored for Middle Eastern cancer patients using integrative transcriptomic and proteomic methodologies. We will use cutting -edge techniques (like single cell transcriptomics, whole genome sequencing and data independent proteomic analysis) to analyze tumor samples from this population and identify unique neoantigens. These neoantigens will then be used to create tailored vaccines.

The project is based on the understanding that different populations have varying cancer risks and responses to treatment due to genetic and environmental factors. Middle Eastern patients have distinct genetic profiles that affect their susceptibility to cancer. Personalized cancer treatments, like neoantigen-based vaccines, can trigger specific immune responses against tumor cells. However, there has been limited research on developing such vaccines for Middle Eastern populations. This project aims to fill this gap and improve cancer treatment for this demographic.
The initial data has shown differences in the genetic and proteomic profiles of tumor samples from Middle Eastern patients compared to other populations. We have identified several candidate neoantigens unique to this population. These findings form a strong basis for our proposed project and highlight the potential of neoantigen-based vaccines to offer personalized cancer treatment for Middle Eastern patients.

Our methodology involves collecting tumor samples from Middle Eastern patients in line with ethical guidelines and obtaining informed consent. We will use high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry to obtain comprehensive genetic and proteomic data from the tumor samples. Advanced bioinformatics tools will help us identify potential neoantigens and evaluate their ability to trigger immune responses. The identified neoantigens will be synthesized into peptide-based vaccines and tested in vitro for their effectiveness in eliciting immune responses. The most promising vaccine candidates will be tested in animal models to assess their efficacy and safety.
We will use statistical analysis to ensure the robustness and validity of our findings. This will involve differential expression analysis of genetic and proteomic data to identify significantly altered genes and proteins and use statistical and deep learning models to predict the immunogenic potential of the neoantigen candidates.

This project utilizes advanced technologies to develop personalized cancer vaccines tailored to the unique genetic makeup of Middle Eastern patients. It has the potential to significantly improve the prognosis and treatment outcomes for breast and lung cancer patients in the region. By focusing on an underserved demographic, this project aligns with the global trend towards personalized medicine, aiming to provide equity in healthcare advancements.
